```{r setup}
library(palmerpenguins)
```


## Problem 1
Loading the `penguins` dataset:
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
View(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```
This dataset describes the species, island, bill size (depth and length), flipper length, body mass, sex, and year catalogued of penguins. There are 344 entries (rows) to the dataset and 8 variables (columns). The average flipper length amongst the penguins is `mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)`.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes (x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color=species)) + geom_point()
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
